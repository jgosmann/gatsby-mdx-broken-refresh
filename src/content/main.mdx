# Hello

1. Run Gatsby in development mode: `npx gatsby develop`
2. Open [http://localhost:8000/main](http://localhost:8000/main) in your browser
3. Open this file with Vim: `vim src/content/main.mdx`
4. Ensure the swap file is active: `:set swapfile`
5. Edit this file and save it.
6. Observe that (despite Gatsby output in the terminal) the page in the browser
   won't update. (Maybe it will still on the first saved edit, but after the
   second edit it should no longer.)
7. Closing Vim (and thus removing the swap file), won't restore the update.
   Even when using a different editor, the page won't update.
